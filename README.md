# Secure Cloud Architecture for Azure Web Applications

This project demonstrates a secure cloud-native architecture for hosting web applications in Microsoft Azure. It follows the principles of Zero Trust, least privilege access, and identity-based security using Microsoftâ€™s ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Infrastructure as Code (IAC) scripts, ensure the following:

- An active Microsoft Azure subscription.
- Access to Azure CLI, PowerShell, and Terraform.
- Azure account with appropriate permissions for resource provisioning (e.g., Contributor role or higher).
- Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) permissions set.
- Proper setup for Azure Monitor and Sentinel for log aggregation and security monitoring.

## Key Components & Security Controls

| Component                  | Purpose / Security Function                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Entra**       | Central identity provider with Conditional Access and MFA              |
| **PIM**                   | Just-in-time access with role elevation                                |
| **RBAC**                  | Role-based access control across all layers                            |
| **Key Vault**             | Secure storage for secrets and credentials                             |
| **Azure APIM**            | API gateway to secure APIs via managed identities and RBAC             |
| **Azure SQL**             | Database with RBAC + Private Link + TDE                                |
| **AKS (Microservices)**   | App backend with network policies, RBAC, managed identity              |
| **Log Analytics** | Log aggregation, detection, and response via SIEM                   |
| **Defender for Cloud**    | Posture management + threat protection across resources                |
| **Azure Monitor & App Insights** | Real-time telemetry and operational monitoring                |
| **DDoS Protection**       | Network-level protection for public-facing services                    |

## Project Files & Automation Scripts

All infrastructure-as-code and query files are located in the `scripts/` directory.

### CLI Scripts (`scripts/CLI-scripts/`)
Shell scripts to provision key services using the Azure CLI:
- `deploy-keyvaults.sh`
- `deploy-sql.sh`
- `deploy-vm.sh`

### PowerShell Scripts (`scripts/powershell-scripts/`)
PowerShell automation for deploying core infrastructure:
- `deploy-keyvault.ps1`
- `deploy-sql.ps1`
- `deploy-vm.ps1`

### Terraform Scripts (`scripts/terraform-scripts/`)
Infrastructure as Code templates for reproducible deployments:
- `deploy-keyvaults.tf`
- `deploy-sql.tf`
- `deploy-vm.tf`

### KQL Queries (`scripts/kql/`)
Log Analytics and Sentinel queries to monitor security events:
- `sign-in-logs.kql` â€“ Monitor successful sign-ins
- `sign-in-failure.kql` â€“ Track failed logins
- `keyvault-access.kql` â€“ Detect abnormal access to secrets
- `rbac-changes.kql` â€“ Watch for changes to role assignments
- `sql-audit-logs.kql` â€“ SQL audit event tracking

## Threat Modeling

A dedicated threat modeling document is included as `threat_model.md` to outline risks, mitigations, and trust boundaries based on the architecture.

---

## Use Case

This architecture can be used by any cloud-native application requiring secure access to APIs, databases, and secrets â€” particularly in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, or enterprise SaaS platforms.
